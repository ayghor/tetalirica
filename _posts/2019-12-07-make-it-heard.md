'Make it heard' (Volume I, II and III) is a compilation of contemporary sonic
production in Brazil, in areas such as improvisation; installation;
instrument-building; new media; performance art; electroacoustic music; poetry;
radio art; and vocal experimentation. Most of the selected works came from
'Making it Heard: A History of Brazilian Sound Art' (Bloomsbury, 2019), a
multi-authored volume edited by Rui Chaves and Fernando Iazzetta. In this book,
a generation of young scholars discusses a body of artwork that spans almost 60
years, through an attentive ear to material, historical, social and political
circumstances. As most of the artworks discussed are not available to the
public, we tried to offer to the potential reader/listener a sample of the
recent Brazilian sound art production. The title 'Making it Heard' indicates
the context in which this production takes place, oscillating between the
persistence of a colonial and patriarchal structure and the pursuit of a
libertarian and democratic perspective. 'Make it Heard' expresses a sense of
urgency in making this body of work audible, one that we hope to continue in
the next few years: recovering, archiving and publishing Brazilian production
in this field.
